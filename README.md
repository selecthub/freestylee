# freestylee
Front-end recruitment task

This repo serves as a base to your own repo where you'd track changes that should be made to the fiddle at the link provided to you in the email.

It's a freestyle. There are suggestions about what could be done listed with checkboxes, but they can be ignored and you can provide your own list. 

The idea is simple: do whatever you can think of to the chart in fiddle to show off your skills and creativity, and follow this simple rules:
* create new private repo and manually recreate this one (don't fork as we don't want to make your changes publicly visible) and give access to the account given in the email - use your repo to commit changes
* try to use one commit per one feature or per refactoring, if you feel you want to do one
* all features should be listed with checkboxes and the final fiddle should have them checked if they are done.
* when you finish, please update this file with final jsFiddle link - please mind that jsFiddle updates URL with any change so once sent URL will not show any changes done after you share it

We will check overall functionality, the way you work and code structure - this last one could be avoided if you mark places where you know that aren't perfect and you already have ideas for refactoring - we will ask about them later.
